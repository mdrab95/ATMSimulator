# atmsimulator
It is simple ATM simulator. User can create an account and do some operations (deposit, withdrawal, user also can transfer funds and check account ballance). Technologies which i used to build this page: ASP.NET MVC 5 (Entity framework 6, OWIN, Json), Bootstrap, jQuery, Knockout.js 
User can also log via facebook (I know it's not a good way to use facebook for apps like this but I wanted to implement it without creating another project)

I uploaded models, views and controllers only.
